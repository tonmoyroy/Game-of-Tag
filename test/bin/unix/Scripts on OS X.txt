A tip for those who use the unix scripts for the labs!
 
The unix scripts chatclient.sh and chatserver.sh could not be run (using OS X), gave me the error: -bash: ./chatserver.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
 
The error occured due to dos line endings of the files. I corrected them to unix endings by using the command :set fileformat=unix in vim.
